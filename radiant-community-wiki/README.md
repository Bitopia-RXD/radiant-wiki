## Radiant is a Peer-to-Peer Digital Asset System

### 21 billion coins

The total supply of Radiant is predetermined for 21 billion RXD, with a 50,000 block emission and 2-year halving time.

### 5 minute (300 secs) block time

Instant transactions with 0-confs

### 256mb default block size

A safe block size to handle high throughput to start, designed fundamentally to achieve 10+ GB and beyond.

### Layer One

Radiant is a layer 1 blockchain with no secondary layers ever needed.

### SHA512/256d

Unique proof-of-work consensus designed to embrace GPU/FPGA/ASICs while being more efficient than Bitcoin.

### 10+ mining pools

Diversified mining pools and solo operators contributing to decentralization.

### 4,000 TX/sec

Protocol designed to handle 4,000 tx/sec with default 256 MB block sizes. Miners can optimize in the future to scale linearly.

### 8 decimal places

Each Radiant has 8 decimal places, and the smallest indivisible unit is called a photon. 100 million photons per RXD coin.

***

### Community driven

Fairly mined with no developer allocation, just technology for you to build with and grow.

### Massively scalable

When you create a hybrid account + UTXO Layer 1 blockchain, you get magic. Imagine no limitations on growth. Imagine fees that are fractions of a penny. Imagine a blockchain that is ready to build on at launch and not always waiting on the next update, pivot, or fix. Imagine Radiant.

### Unbounded creativity

Make your dreams come to life – auctions, games, tokens, apps, NFTs – anything you can think of with ultra-flexible Turing Complete smart contracts. Radiant allows creatives of all kinds to have real ownership of their digital assets and use the peer-to-peer network to monetize and exchange their creations.

### PoW SHA512/256

Proof-of-work is the only consensus system for maximum security and efficiency. Embracing full decentralization so that no miner can stake to centralize the network. Fairly launched and community mined from the beginning. The FIPS SHA512/256 Standard is up to 50% more efficient than SHA256 on 64 bit architectures.

### Full stack open source

The Radiant Node, associated modules, and libraries were released upon launch. All source code is available as open source (MIT licensed) and comes with no warranties or guarantees of any kind. It is free to use or copy as users and developers wish.

### Network fuel

The fuel for the network is the Radiant unit (RXD). A small amount of RXD is used to pay transaction fees to miners for processing transfers and for the execution of smart contracts.

### Proof of Work is green

Proof-of-Work uses energy intensive processes to secure the network but is highly efficient. This is because POW’s energy expenditure needs to be weighed against the massive energy usage of the legacy systems that POW replaces. When POW’s energy consumption is examined in the context of current wasteful legacy systems, POW is highly energy efficient and green.

### Induction proofs

The induction proof system makes it possible to efficiently compose outputs in any manner, without compromising the inherent parallelism and scalability characteristics of the UTXO based architecture.

### Account emulation

With the novel induction proof technique, it is now possible to create globally unique identifiers and therefore implement accounts in the UTXO based architecture. The best of both worlds in emulating the account models while also providing the coin (UTXO) model that offers massive scale and parallelism.
