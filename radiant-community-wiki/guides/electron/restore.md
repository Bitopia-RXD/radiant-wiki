## RESTORE WALLET - ELECTRON WALLET <a href="#restore-wallet-electron-wallet" id="restore-wallet-electron-wallet"></a>

The Electron wallet uses BIP39 to store the wallet keys. Samara and Chainbow also use BIP39 to host these keys, making all these wallets compatible with each other.

It is very important to have these words stored securely, as without them it is not possible to retrieve the stored funds. More information about BIP39
